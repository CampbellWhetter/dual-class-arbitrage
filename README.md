# Dual-Class Arbitrage

## Overview
The Dual-Class Arbitrage Application is a full-stack web application designed to analyze dual-listed securities and generate clear trading strategies that exploit price discrepancies. The `Analyze Securities` page integrates real-time market data through the yfinance API, enabling users to input custom investment amounts and receive hedged trading strategies. The `Live Results` page showcases key performance metrics for a dual-class arbitrage strategy that I developed and backtested on QuantConnect, using Alphabetâ€™s Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Class C (NASDAQ: GOOG) shares as a case study for pairs trading.
